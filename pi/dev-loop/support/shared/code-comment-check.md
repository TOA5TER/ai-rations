# Code Comment Compliance Check

Shared procedure, referenced by `developing/SKILL.md` (Pre-Completion Verification) and
`addressing-pr-comments/SKILL.md` (Step 5: Verify) — mirrors how `adversarial-review.md`
is a single procedure file invoked by reference from multiple call sites rather than copy-pasted.

Run this as a mechanical grep, not a prose reminder — it backstops the "Code Comments" rule in
`standards.md`, which was violated even though the rule was already written down.

## Step 1: Resolve the base ref

Resolve the default branch the same way `adversarial-review.md` (Step 3) does:

```bash
git fetch origin
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'
```

If this does not resolve (e.g. `fatal: ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref`), repair
it and re-resolve:

```bash
git remote set-head origin -a
```

**If the base ref still cannot be resolved after the repair attempt, this check blocks completion
— it does not pass.** Report the failure and stop. Do not treat an unresolved base as "no changes
found" and do not let the check silently no-op.

## Step 2: Find changed lines

Using the resolved base ref `{base}`, diff against the merge-base with **three-dot** syntax, not
two-dot — two-dot renders base-branch-only commits as inverted additions and flags lines this
branch never touched, and the gap grows unbounded as the branch ages:

```bash
git diff {base}...HEAD --name-only
```

For each changed file:

```bash
git diff {base}...HEAD -U0 -- {file}
```

Keep only lines prefixed with a single `+` (excluding the `+++` file-header line) — these are the
lines added or modified on this branch.

## Step 3: Identify comment lines

Among those added/modified lines, a line counts as a comment when, ignoring leading whitespace, it
starts with a line-comment marker recognized for that file's extension, or falls inside an added
block-comment marker recognized for that extension:

- `.tf` (HCL) — line markers `#` and `//` (HCL accepts both), block marker `/* … */`
- `.yaml`/`.yml`, `.py`, `.sh`, `.rb` — `#` only
- `.go`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.java`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.rs` — `//` line marker and `/* … */`
  block marker
- `.sql`, `.lua` — `--` line marker only

A block-comment marker is only detected when the diff makes the opening delimiter itself an added
(`+`-prefixed) line; because `git diff -U0` isolates changed lines with no surrounding context, a
line that is textually inside a block comment whose opening delimiter was not itself touched by
this branch cannot be identified as a comment by this check and is out of scope — a known
limitation of the `-U0` approach. Unrecognized extensions are skipped (not blocked).

## Step 4: Match patterns

**Patterns (a)-(c) are PCRE patterns — run with `grep -P` (or `rg`).** A POSIX-ERE-only `grep` on
PATH (e.g. ugrep without `-P`) will silently under-match or mis-match some of these — verify `-P`
(or `rg`) is actually what executes before trusting a clean result.

Match against each comment line's text, case-insensitive, "on the same line" as the concrete
reading of "adjacent" (informally, within about 40 characters):

- (a) story ID — `\bsc-[0-9]+\b`
- (b) commit hash — `\b(commit(s|ted)?|sha|hash|rev)\b.{0,40}\b[0-9a-f]{7,40}\b` or
  `\b[0-9a-f]{7,40}\b.{0,40}\b(commit(s|ted)?|sha|hash|rev)\b`
- (c) CI run ID — `\b(run|ci)\b.{0,40}\b[0-9]{8,}\b` or `\b[0-9]{8,}\b.{0,40}\b(run|ci)\b`, or a
  substring matching `github\.com/\S+/actions/runs/[0-9]+`. The 8-digit floor on the bare-numeric
  alternatives is deliberate — it eliminates false positives on small numbers (durations, counts,
  thresholds) that are not run IDs while still matching real CI run IDs, which run 9-11 digits.
  The `actions/runs/` URL alternative has no digit floor because the URL shape itself is
  unambiguous.

**Pattern (d) is not a single-line PCRE match** — a "contiguous run longer than N lines" is a
run-length count across consecutive lines, not something one line's text can satisfy on its own.
It is checked separately, per file, after (a)-(c):

- (d) verbose comment block — a contiguous run of added (`+`-prefixed) comment lines, per Step 3's
  per-extension comment-line detection, with no non-comment or blank line breaking the run, whose
  count exceeds 4 lines. A `@@` hunk header always ends the current run — Step 2 keeps only
  `+`-prefixed lines and discards hunk headers, so without this rule two unrelated comment blocks
  from opposite ends of a file would splice into one run. **Exempt from the count:**
  - A PEP-723 inline-script header, i.e. a run whose first line is a `#!` shebang and whose second
    line is `# /// script` — a Python interpreter directive, not an authored comment. Skip the
    whole header (through its closing `# ///` line) rather than trimming it line-by-line; anything
    genuinely authored immediately after the header starts its own, separately-counted run.
  - The mandatory test "why" comment required by `standards.md`'s Testing Standards
    (and carved out from the Code Comments rule at `standards.md:324`) — a run of added comment
    lines in a test file that immediately follows an added test-declaration line (`def test_...`,
    `it(...)`, `test(...)`, `describe(...)`, or the file's equivalent). This is the one place
    `standards.md` mandates the reasoning live in the comment, so a longer block there is not the
    problem pattern (d) exists to catch. The exemption covers only the single run immediately
    following the test declaration; any later comment block in the same test body is not exempt
    and is counted normally.

  For each changed file, run per-hunk (substitute the file's actual comment-line marker(s) from
  Step 3 for `#`/`//` below):

  ```bash
  git diff {base}...HEAD -U0 -- {file} | awk -v is_test="$(echo {file} | grep -qiE 'test' && echo 1 || echo 0)" '
    /^@@/          { streak = 0; prev_test_def = 0; in_test_comment = 0; next }
    /^\+#!/        { streak = 0; prev_test_def = 0; next }               # shebang line, never counted
    /^\+# \/\/\/ script/ { in_pep723 = 1; next }       # PEP-723 header open, skip through close
    in_pep723 && /^\+# \/\/\/$/ { in_pep723 = 0; next }
    in_pep723      { next }
    is_test && /^\+[[:space:]]*(def[[:space:]]+test_|it\(|test\(|describe\()/ {
      streak = 0; prev_test_def = 1; in_test_comment = 0; next
    }
    /^\+[[:space:]]*(#|\/\/)/ {
      if (streak == 0 && prev_test_def) { in_test_comment = 1 }
      streak++
      if (!in_test_comment && streak > 4) { print FILENAME ": pattern (d) verbose comment block"; exit 1 }
      next
    }
    { streak = 0; prev_test_def = 0; in_test_comment = 0 }
  '
  ```

## Step 5: On any match

Do not declare work complete. Report the file, line, and which pattern matched (including pattern
(d)'s line-count threshold when that is the match); the offending citation or verbose block must be
rephrased, trimmed, or removed per the "Code Comments" rule in `standards.md`, and the
check re-run. There is no suppression or override path — this blocks on any match, even given the
heuristic's occasional false positive (e.g. a line reading "let the migration run for 100000000 ms
before checking" or "the nightly batch run processed 12345678 rows" would trip pattern (c); rephrase
it rather than bypass the check).

## Execution scope

- **Single-repo path** (`addressing-pr-comments`; single-repo `developing`): runs once, from
  the repo root, as part of the calling skill's own verification step.
- **Multi-repo path** (`developing` Step 3): runs once per repo, from that repo's own root,
  as part of that repo's self-review before its PR is opened (mirroring how "Internal Code
  Review" is scoped per repo in that path). Never run it from the multi-repo workspace parent.
