  Three-mode unified skill for debugging bugs, standalone story implementation, and addressing PR
  review feedback (rework). Mode is auto-detected from arguments: no args = debug mode
  (investigate a reported bug), story-id only = development mode (implement a story), story-id +
  --rework = rework mode (address reviewer feedback). Use whenever a bug needs systematic
  investigation, review changes need addressing, or a story needs implementing without the full
  developer workflow.

# Debugging (Debug / Development / Rework)

**Role:** Unified skill for debugging, development, and rework — mode detected from arguments

**SCOPE BOUNDARY:** This skill **never** creates PM stories, tickets, issues, or subtasks — the Story Creation Gate in `../../support/shared/standards.md` applies.

## Arguments

The arguments are whatever the user typed after the skill invocation (the text following `/skill:<name>`); treat that text as `the arguments` throughout.

Read `../../support/shared/standards.md` — these mandatory rules govern this entire session.

Read `../../support/shared/adapter-loading.md` — adapter loading procedures referenced in Development Mode and Rework Mode.

## Mode Detection

Parse arguments:

- **Empty** → **Debugging mode** — wait for user to describe the bug
- **Story ID only** (e.g., `sc-12345`) → **Development mode** — implement the story
- **Story ID + `--rework`** (e.g., `sc-12345 --rework`) → **Rework mode** — address story comments

---

## Debugging Mode

_Triggered when: no arguments provided_

### Step 1: Gather Information

Wait for the user to describe the bug. Do not proactively ask questions — let them guide the session.

You need:

- What is broken
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected environment(s)

### Step 2: Reproduce the Bug

- Follow the reproduction steps provided
- Verify the issue occurs as described
- Document exact conditions that trigger it

### Step 3: Collect Evidence

- Gather logs, error messages, stack traces
- Check recent git history: `git log --oneline -20`
- Review test coverage for affected areas

### Step 4: Root Cause Analysis

Apply systematic debugging discipline before tracing code:

> Invoke Skill: `systematic-debugging`
>
> Use the evidence from Step 3 as the input to Phase 1 (Root Cause Investigation).
> Complete all four phases before proceeding to Step 5. Do not propose any fix until
> hypothesis testing (Phase 3) is complete.

- Trace code execution to where behavior diverges
- Use Read tool to examine relevant files
- Use Grep to find related patterns
- Document findings with file:line references

### Step 5: Fix with TDD

Apply the full TDD cycle:

> Invoke Skill: `test-driven-development`
>
> Write the failing test that reproduces the root cause from Step 4. Watch it fail (RED).
> Implement only the root-cause fix (GREEN). Run full suite and refactor if needed (REFACTOR).
> Do not implement changes beyond what is required to fix this specific root cause.

- **Write failing test first** that reproduces the bug
- Verify test fails before fixing
- Implement fix following existing patterns
- Verify test passes after fix
- Run full test suite to check for regressions

### Step 5.5: Verify Fix Before Committing

> Invoke Skill: `verification-before-completion`
>
> Verify with fresh execution:
>
> - The bug-reproducing test now passes (run it now)
> - The full test suite passes (run it now)
> - No regressions in adjacent modules

### Step 6: Commit and Create PR

- Branch naming: `fix/[brief-description]`
- PR body: describe the bug, root cause (with file:line refs), and fix
- Include test results as evidence

### Step 7: Adversarial Review

Read and follow the adversarial review procedure in `../../support/shared/adversarial-review.md` with these context variables:

- `story_id`: (empty — no story in debug mode)
- `review_target`: "bug fix on branch"
- `review_context`: the bug description from Step 1, root cause analysis from Step 4, and the reproduction test name from Step 5

The adversarial agent verifies the fix actually addresses the identified root cause, the test genuinely reproduces the original bug (not a different scenario), and no regressions were introduced.

---

## Development Mode

_Triggered when: story ID provided (no --rework flag)_

### Step 1: Load Adapters and Story

1. Read `{agentDir}/dev-workflow/config.json` for `pm_adapter` and `notes_adapter`
2. Load PM adapter per procedure in `../../support/shared/adapter-loading.md` → fetch story by ID
3. Load notes adapter per procedure in `../../support/shared/adapter-loading.md` → read Claude Instructions spec
4. **If spec not found:** STOP and ask user to invoke the Writer skill (`dev-loop-writing-specs`) with this story ID first. Never create a story, ticket, or issue to fill the gap

### Step 1.5: Write Implementation Plan

After loading the Claude Instructions spec:

> Invoke Skill: `writing-plans`
>
> OVERRIDE: Save the plan as a standalone HTML document to `./.scratch/tmp/YYYY-MM-DD-<story-id>-plan.html`.
> Use the Claude Instructions spec as the feature description.

### Step 2: Branch

- Check current branch — if on `main`, the new branch (`feature/`, `fix/`, or `chore/`) is created inside the isolated worktree set up in Step 2.5, not checked out here first
- If already on a feature branch, check if a PR exists

### Step 2.5: Inline Implementation

With the plan written, and before creating the branch, implement the plan inline in this
session — there are no subagents:

> Invoke Skill: `executing-plans`
>
> REQUIRED: Set up workspace isolation before starting, per `../../support/shared/standards.md` →
> "Workspace Isolation" — the worktree carries the feature branch (see Step 2 above).
> Worktree isolation is required for this task — proceed without asking; if baseline tests
> fail, report the failure and stop rather than asking whether to proceed. When this
> reaches a nested `finishing-a-development-branch` invocation, pass it the cleanup
> instruction that skill needs (preserve the worktree for PR-feedback iteration), not the
> creation requirement above — that skill only tears down.

### Step 3: Implement with TDD

- Write failing tests first based on acceptance criteria

  Apply the full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:

  > Invoke Skill: `test-driven-development`

- Implement following Claude Instructions step-by-step
- Run tests after each significant change
- Follow existing architecture patterns

### Step 3.5: Verify Before Pushing

> Invoke Skill: `verification-before-completion`
>
> Verify with fresh execution:
>
> - All tests pass (run the full suite now)
> - No files left unstaged

### Step 4: Commit and Push

- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Run all tests and fix any failures before pushing
- Push to remote branch

### Step 5: Create PR

- Title: concise and descriptive
- Body: summary + story reference (PM adapter format) + testing steps from Claude Instructions
- NO AI-generated boilerplate

### Step 6: Adversarial Review

Read and follow the adversarial review procedure in `../../support/shared/adversarial-review.md` with these context variables:

- `story_id`: the story ID from arguments
- `review_target`: "code changes on branch"
- `review_context`: the Claude Instructions spec loaded in Step 1

The adversarial agent verifies the implementation satisfies all spec requirements and story acceptance criteria.

**Worktree cleanup is manual when Development Mode runs standalone.** A human running `debugging <story-id>` directly has no such reclamation point — look up the worktree live via `git -C <repo root> worktree list --porcelain` (matching the entry whose branch is this story's feature branch), and once the PR is merged the human should run `git -C <repo root> worktree remove <path>` followed by `git -C <repo root> worktree prune` (or delegate to `finishing-a-development-branch`).

---

## Rework Mode

_Triggered when: story ID + `--rework` provided_

### Step 1: Load Context

1. Read `{agentDir}/dev-workflow/config.json` for `pm_adapter` and `notes_adapter`
2. Load PM adapter per procedure in `../../support/shared/adapter-loading.md` → fetch story by ID (title, description, acceptance criteria, **all comments**)
3. Load notes adapter per procedure in `../../support/shared/adapter-loading.md` → read Claude Instructions spec (best-effort — continue even if missing; rework requirements from comments take precedence)

### Step 2: Extract Rework Requirements

Parse all story comments chronologically (oldest to newest). Identify:

- Reviewer change requests
- Rejection notes or reasons
- Bug reports or edge cases found
- Requests to update logic, naming, structure, or tests

**Summarize as a numbered checklist before writing any code:**

```
## Rework Items Identified

1. [Summary of item from comment dated YYYY-MM-DD by @author]
2. [Summary of another item]
```

**If no comments indicate rework:**

- STOP and ask: "I don't see any comments describing rework requirements. Can you clarify what needs to be changed?"

### Step 2.5: Process Review Feedback

Apply structured reception of the code review feedback before implementing:

> Invoke Skill: `receiving-code-review`
>
> Use the rework checklist from Step 2 as the "feedback" input. Complete the RECEPTION
> (restate items), VERIFICATION (check against actual codebase), EVALUATION (identify
> any valid pushback), and RESPONSE phases before creating the branch in Step 3. This
> ensures each rework item is understood in codebase context before implementation.

### Step 3: Create New Branch

**ALWAYS** create a new `fix/` branch — never reuse an existing rework branch. Set up
workspace isolation first, per `../../support/shared/standards.md` → "Workspace Isolation": use
`using-git-worktrees` to create an isolated workspace, then create the branch
(`fix/<story-id>-rework`, or more descriptively `fix/<story-id>-address-review-feedback`) inside
it — not in the primary checkout, the way an unqualified `git checkout -b` would here. Work
from that worktree for every remaining step. Worktree isolation is required for this task —
proceed without asking; if baseline tests fail, report the failure and stop rather than
asking whether to proceed.

### Step 4: Implement with TDD

- Address ONLY the items from story comments — no scope creep
- Write failing tests for each rework item, then fix

  Apply the full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:

  > Invoke Skill: `test-driven-development`

- Commit frequently with descriptive messages

### Step 4.5: Verify Before Creating PR

> Invoke Skill: `verification-before-completion`
>
> Verify with fresh execution:
>
> - Each rework item from the Step 2 checklist has a passing test
> - Full test suite passes
> - Code is pushed to remote

### Step 5: Create PR

PR body format:

```markdown
## Summary

[What was reworked and why]

[Story reference in PM adapter format]

## Rework Items Addressed

1. [Item 1 from comments — what was changed]
2. [Item 2 from comments — what was changed]

## How to Test

- [ ] [Step to verify rework item 1]
- [ ] [Step to verify rework item 2]
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
```

### Step 6: Adversarial Review

Read and follow the adversarial review procedure in `../../support/shared/adversarial-review.md` with these context variables:

- `story_id`: the story ID from arguments
- `review_target`: "rework changes on branch"
- `review_context`: the rework checklist from Step 2 and the Claude Instructions spec from Step 1

The adversarial agent verifies each rework item from the checklist was properly addressed.

**Worktree cleanup is manual when Rework Mode runs standalone.** A human running `debugging <story-id> --rework` directly has no such reclamation point — look up the worktree live via `git -C <repo root> worktree list --porcelain` (matching the entry whose branch is this story's feature branch), and once the PR is merged the human should run `git -C <repo root> worktree remove <path>` followed by `git -C <repo root> worktree prune` (or delegate to `finishing-a-development-branch`).
